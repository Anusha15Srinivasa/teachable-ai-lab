Cobweb is an concept clustering model which supports incremental concept learning from fewer examples. The model approaches conceptual learning in multimodal way which is human like. The model learns both structures and parameters where the structural expansion of the model is dynamic. Future goals are to optimize the existing model, integrate concept learning with skill learning and organize skills with the model.
