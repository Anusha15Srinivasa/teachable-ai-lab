This research line explores human-inspired models of concept formation. Unlike most ML work, which emphasizes batch processing over structure-less vectors, I emphasize the incremental acquisition of structured concepts from a continuous stream of experiences. 

The primary output of this work has been the [concept formation
library](https://github.com/cmaclell/concept_formation) for python.
