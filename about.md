![Three Teachable AI Lab research thrusts and how they relate to one
another][research thrusts]

The Teachable AI Lab, which is housed in [Drexel University][drexel home]'s
[College of Computing and Informatics][cci home], engages in both
_use-inspired_ and _fundamental_ research to better understand how people teach
and learn and to build machines that can teach and learn like people do. Our research focuses on three thrust areas: (1) **teachable systems**, (2) **Human-Like AI/ML Models**, and (3) Computational Models of Human Learning and Decision Making. See our [research](research.html) and [publications](publications.html) page for more information about our work.

# Interested in getting involved?

Please send an email briefly detailing your background and interests to
[Christopher MacLellan](mailto:christopher.maclellan@drexel.edu).

Our lab is committed to developing a positive lab culture where individuals
feel supported and invested in the lab mission (for more information see our
[lab manual][lab manual]). Towards this end, we seek to recruit, support, and
retain members from diverse backgrounds and groups that have historically been
underrepresented in the sciences.
