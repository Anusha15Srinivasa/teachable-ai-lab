The Teachable AI Lab (or TAIL for short) is an interdisciplinary research group at
[Drexel University][drexel home]'s [College of Computing and Informatics][cci
home]. We engage in both _use-inspired_ and _fundamental_ research to better
understand how people teach and learn and to build machines that can teach and
learn like people do. 

# What we do

Our research focuses on three thrust areas: (1) **Teachable Systems**, (2)
**Human-Like AI/ML Models**, and (3) **Computational Models of Human Learning and
Decision Making**. See our [research](research.html) and
[publications](publications.html) page for more information about our work.
